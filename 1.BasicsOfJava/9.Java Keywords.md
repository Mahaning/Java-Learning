# Java Keywords

**6 May 2025** | ⏱️ *5 min read*

Java keywords are also known as **reserved words**. These are predefined words in Java and cannot be used as variable names, class names, or method names.

## 📌 Example

```java
// Program of Java keywords    
public class Main {      
    public static void main(String[] args) {      
        // Using int keyword    
        int a = 10;    
        int b = 20;    

        // Using if-else keywords    
        if (a < b) {    
            System.out.println(a + " is less than " + b);    
        } else {    
            System.out.println(a + " is greater than " + b);    
        }    
    }      
}
```
Output:
```
10 is less than 20
```
