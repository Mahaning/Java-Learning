## What is Binding?

Binding in Java is the process of linking a method call to the actual method body (the code to be executed). When a method is invoked, Java needs to determine which method implementation to execute.

There are two types of binding:

- **Static Binding** (also known as *Early Binding*)
- **Dynamic Binding** (also known as *Late Binding*)

---

## Understanding Types in Java

Before diving into binding, itâ€™s important to understand three types related to variables and objects:

1. **Variable Type**:  
   Every variable in Java has a type, which can be primitive or reference.

   ```java
   int data = 30; // 'data' is of type int
````

2. **Reference Type**:
   A reference variable points to an object of a specific class type.

   ```java
   class Dog {  
       public static void main(String args[]) {  
           Dog d1; // 'd1' is a reference of type Dog  
       }  
   }
   ```

3. **Object Type**:
   An object is an instance of a class. Importantly, it is also an instance of all its superclasses.

   ```java
   class Animal {}  

   class Dog extends Animal {  
       public static void main(String args[]) {  
           Dog d1 = new Dog();  
       }  
   }
   ```

   Here, the object `d1` is of type `Dog`, but also of type `Animal` (its superclass).

## Static Binding (Early Binding)

* **When does it happen?**
  Static binding occurs at **compile time**, when the compiler knows exactly which method to call based on the type information available.

* **Applicable for:**

  * `private` methods
  * `final` methods
  * `static` methods
  * Constructors

These methods cannot be overridden, so the compiler can bind calls to them at compile time.

### Example of Static Binding

```java
class Dog {  
    private void eat() {  
        System.out.println("dog is eating...");  
    }  

    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Dog d1 = new Dog();  
        d1.eat();  // Compiler knows exactly which method to call
    }  
}
```

**Output:**

```
dog is eating...
```

Here, the method `eat()` is `private`, so it cannot be overridden. The compiler knows exactly which `eat()` to call during compilation.

---

## Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)

* **When does it happen?**
  Dynamic binding occurs at **runtime**, when the JVM determines which method to invoke based on the actual object type, not just the reference type.

* **Applicable for:**

  * Overridden instance methods (non-static, non-final, non-private)

Dynamic binding enables **polymorphism**, allowing a method call to invoke different method implementations depending on the actual object type at runtime.

### Example of Dynamic Binding

```java
class Animal {  
    void eat() {  
        System.out.println("animal is eating...");  
    }  
}  

class Dog extends Animal {  
    void eat() {  
        System.out.println("dog is eating...");  
    }  

    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Reference type is Animal, object type is Dog  
        a.eat();  // Method called is based on Dog's implementation (runtime decision)
    }  
}
```

**Output:**

```
dog is eating...
```

* Although the reference `a` is of type `Animal`, the object it points to is of type `Dog`.
* The method call `a.eat()` is resolved at runtime, and Dog's overridden `eat()` is executed.

## Summary Table: Static vs Dynamic Binding

| Aspect              | Static Binding (Early Binding)       | Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| When Binding Occurs | Compile time                         | Runtime                                 |
| Applicable To       | `private`, `final`, `static` methods | Overridden instance methods             |
| Method Overriding   | Not applicable                       | Applicable                              |
| Polymorphism        | No                                   | Yes                                     |
| Performance         | Faster (determined at compile time)  | Slightly slower (determined at runtime) |

## Why is Dynamic Binding Important?

Dynamic binding is a key feature of **polymorphism** in Java, allowing flexible and maintainable code. It enables:

* Methods to behave differently based on the actual object type at runtime.
* Decoupling code, since you can work with superclass references but invoke subclass implementations.
* Easier extensibility, as new subclasses can override methods without changing existing code.

---

## Visualization of Binding

```
Reference Type: Animal      Object Type: Dog

At Compile Time: Compiler only knows Reference Type -> Animal's methods are considered.

At Runtime: JVM checks actual Object Type -> Dog's overridden methods are invoked.
```

## Key Points to Remember

* Static binding is used when method calls can be resolved at compile time (like private or static methods).
* Dynamic binding is used for overridden methods, resolved at runtime, enabling polymorphism.
* Variables are bound statically; method calls (non-static) can be dynamically bound.
