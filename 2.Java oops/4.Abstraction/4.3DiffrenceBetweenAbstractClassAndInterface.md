# Difference between Abstract Class and Interface in Java

## Abstract Class

An **abstract class** in Java is a class declared with the `abstract` keyword. It can contain:

* Abstract methods (methods without a body)
* Concrete methods (methods with implementation)

You **cannot instantiate** an abstract class directly. It is meant to be extended by other classes which provide implementations for its abstract methods.

### Example of Abstract Class

```java
// Simple Example of Abstract Class in Java    
abstract class Shape {      
    abstract void draw();      
}      

// Child class that provides implementation    
class Rectangle extends Shape {      
    void draw() { System.out.println("drawing rectangle"); }      
}      

// Main class to create objects and call methods    
public class Main {      
    public static void main(String args[]) {      
        Shape s = new Rectangle();    
        s.draw();      
    }      
}  
```

**Output:**

```
drawing rectangle
```

## Interface

An **interface** in Java is a blueprint of a class. It contains:

* Abstract methods (no method bodies)
* Static constants (fields are public, static, final by default)

Interfaces achieve:

* Full abstraction (only method signatures, no implementations except for default/static/private methods since Java 8/9)
* Multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces)

### Example of Interface

```java
// Simple Example of Interface in Java    
interface Shape {      
    void draw();  // implicitly public and abstract    
}      

// Child class that implements the interface    
class Rectangle implements Shape {      
    public void draw() { System.out.println("drawing rectangle"); }      
}      

// Main class to create objects and call methods    
public class Main {      
    public static void main(String args[]) {      
        Shape s = new Rectangle();    
        s.draw();      
    }      
}  
```

**Output:**

```
drawing rectangle
```

## Abstract Class vs Interface — Key Differences

| Feature              | Abstract Class                                                     | Interface                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Methods              | Can have abstract and concrete methods                             | Can have only abstract methods (since Java 8, can have default and static methods)     |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported (a class can extend one class)                       | Supported (a class can implement multiple interfaces)                                  |
| Variables/Fields     | Can have instance variables (final, non-final, static, non-static) | Only `public static final` constants                                                   |
| Keyword              | Declared using `abstract` keyword                                  | Declared using `interface` keyword                                                     |
| Inheritance          | Can extend one class and implement multiple interfaces             | Can extend multiple interfaces                                                         |
| Constructors         | Can have constructors                                              | Cannot have constructors                                                               |
| Access Modifiers     | Can have any access modifiers (private, protected, public)         | Members are `public` by default                                                        |
| Implementation       | Can provide partial implementation                                 | Traditionally no implementation (except default/static/private methods since Java 8/9) |
| Use Case             | Use when sharing common base functionality or state                | Use when defining a contract or capability                                             |

## Combined Example: Abstract Class Implementing Interface

```java
// Interface with four abstract methods
interface A {      
    void a();      
    void b();      
    void c();      
    void d();      
}      

// Abstract class partially implementing interface A
abstract class B implements A {      
    public void c() { System.out.println("I am C"); }      
}      

// Concrete subclass implementing remaining methods
class C extends B {      
    public void a() { System.out.println("I am a"); }      
    public void b() { System.out.println("I am b"); }      
    public void d() { System.out.println("I am d"); }      
}      

// Main class calling the methods
public class Main {      
    public static void main(String args[]) {      
        A a = new C();      
        a.a();      
        a.b();      
        a.c();      
        a.d();      
    }    
}  
```

**Output:**

```
I am a
I am b
I am c
I am d
```

## Important Points to Remember

* Abstract classes provide **partial abstraction (0-100%)** while interfaces provide **full abstraction (100%)**.
* Interfaces support **multiple inheritance**, avoiding diamond problem, while abstract classes do not.
* Abstract classes can have constructors, instance variables, static methods, and various access levels.
* Interfaces cannot have constructors; all members are implicitly public, static, and final by default.
* Since Java 8, interfaces can have **default** and **static** methods with implementation.
* A class can extend only one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces.
* Abstract classes are better suited for sharing common base code and state.
* Interfaces are ideal for defining contracts and capabilities for unrelated classes.
* Classes can combine both by extending an abstract class and implementing one or more interfaces simultaneously.
* Interfaces promote loose coupling and flexible designs, often used in API definitions.
