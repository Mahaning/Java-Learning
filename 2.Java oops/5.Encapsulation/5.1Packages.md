## What is a Package in Java?

A **Java package** is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes, interfaces, and sub-packages. It groups similar types to avoid name conflicts and to control access.

Think of it like folders in a file system where related files are stored together.

---

## Why Use Packages?

### 1. Avoid Naming Conflicts

Suppose you have two `Employee` classes, one in HR and another in IT department. Without packages, the compiler wouldn't know which one to use if you just write `Employee`.

Packages allow us to differentiate:

* `company.hr.Employee`
* `company.it.Employee`

This fully qualified name avoids naming collisions.

### 2. Organize Classes

Packages help organize related classes and interfaces logically.

For example:

* `java.util` contains utility classes like `ArrayList`, `HashMap`.
* `java.io` contains classes related to input/output.

### 3. Control Access

Java uses package-level access modifiers like **default** and **protected** to control visibility of classes and members within and outside packages.

### 4. Promote Reusability and Encapsulation

By grouping classes, packages promote better encapsulation and code reuse.

---

## Package Declaration Syntax

```java
package package_name;
```

This should be the **first line** in a Java source file.

---

## Example: Simple Package

**File:** `Main.java`

```java
package mypackage;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Welcome to the package");
    }
}
```

---

## Compiling and Running Package Classes

1. Compile with directory structure created automatically:

```bash
javac -d . Main.java
```

The `-d .` option tells the compiler to create the package directories starting from the current directory.

2. Run the program:

```bash
java mypackage.Main
```

---

## Accessing Classes from Packages

### Importing Specific Class

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

Allows usage of `ArrayList` without fully qualified name.

### Importing All Classes

```java
import java.util.*;
```

Imports all classes and interfaces from `java.util` package (but not subpackages).

### Fully Qualified Class Name Usage

You can use a class without import by using the fully qualified name:

```java
java.util.ArrayList<Integer> list = new java.util.ArrayList<>();
```

---

## Types of Packages

### 1. Built-in Packages

Java provides many predefined packages, such as:

| Package       | Description                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `java.lang`   | Core Java classes (String, Math, System) |
| `java.util`   | Utility classes (Collections, Date)      |
| `java.io`     | Input/Output related classes             |
| `java.net`    | Networking classes                       |
| `java.awt`    | GUI components                           |
| `java.applet` | Applet-related classes                   |

Note: `java.lang` is imported by default.

### 2. User-defined Packages

You can create your own packages to group related classes.

---

## User-defined Package Example

Assume directory structure:

```
project/
├── mypackage1/
│   └── Class1.java
├── mypackage2/
│   └── Class2.java
└── Main.java
```

### Class1.java

```java
package mypackage1;

public class Class1 {
    public void get1() {
        System.out.println("Inside package 1.");
    }
}
```

### Class2.java

```java
package mypackage2;

public class Class2 {
    public void get2() {
        System.out.println("Inside package 2.");
    }
}
```

### Main.java

```java
import mypackage1.Class1;
import mypackage2.Class2;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Class1 obj1 = new Class1();
        Class2 obj2 = new Class2();
        obj1.get1();
        obj2.get2();
    }
}
```

---

### Compiling all files and creating directories:

```bash
javac -d . *.java
```

### Running:

```bash
java Main
```

**Output:**

```
Inside package 1.
Inside package 2.
```

---

## Important Note on Access Modifiers in Packages

* Classes must be declared **public** if they are to be accessed outside their package.
* If a class is declared with **default** (no modifier) or **protected**, it cannot be accessed outside the package, leading to compile-time errors.

---

## Naming Conventions for Packages

* Package names are all **lowercase**.
* Components of package names are separated by dots (`.`).
* Example: `com.company.project`

---

## Subpackages

A **subpackage** is a package inside another package.

Example:
`java.util` is a subpackage of `java`

### Subpackage Example:

```java
package com.tpointtech.core;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello subpackage");
    }
}
```

Compile with:

```bash
javac -d . Main.java
```

Run with:

```bash
java com.tpointtech.core.Main
```

---

## Static Import (Java 5 Feature)

Allows access to **static members** (methods/fields) of a class without class name prefix.

Example:

```java
import static java.lang.System.out;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        out.println("Inside the main method");
    }
}
```

---

## Handling Name Conflicts

When two packages contain classes with the same name, importing both leads to ambiguity.

Example:

```java
import java.sql.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Date d = new Date(44l);  // Error: ambiguous reference to Date
    }
}
```

### Solution: Use Fully Qualified Class Name

```java
java.sql.Date d = new java.sql.Date(44l);
```

# Summary Diagram: Package Structure and Usage

```
project/
├── com/
│   └── company/
│       ├── core/
│       │    └── Main.java        (package com.company.core)
│       └── utils/
│            └── Helper.java      (package com.company.utils)
└── Main.java                    (default package or another package)
```

* Classes inside `com.company.core` use package statement: `package com.company.core;`
* Classes inside `com.company.utils` use package statement: `package com.company.utils;`
