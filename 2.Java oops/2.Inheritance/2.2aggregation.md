## What is Aggregation?

In Java, **Aggregation** is a concept where one class contains a reference to another class. It represents a **HAS-A** relationship.

> If a class has an entity reference, it is known as Aggregation.

---

## Example Scenario

Suppose you have an `Employee` class that includes details such as `id`, `name`, etc. It also contains an `Address` object which holds data like `city`, `state`, and `country`.

```java
class Employee {
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address; // Address is another class (HAS-A relationship)
    //...
}
```

This means:

* **Employee HAS-A Address**

---

## Why Use Aggregation?

* **Code Reusability**
* Promotes **modular** design
* Better choice than inheritance when there is no "is-a" relationship

---

## Simple Aggregation Example

This example demonstrates code reusability by referencing the `Operation` class inside `Circle`.

```java
class Operation {
    int square(int n) {
        return n * n;
    }
}

class Circle {
    Operation op; // Aggregation (HAS-A Relationship)
    double pi = 3.14;

    double area(int radius) {
        op = new Operation();
        int rsquare = op.square(radius);
        return pi * rsquare;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle c = new Circle();
        double result = c.area(5);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

### Output

```
78.5
```

## When to Use Aggregation?

* When there's **no IS-A relationship**
* When **code reuse** is required
* When the relationship is **not permanent**, i.e., an object can exist without the other
* Prefer **aggregation** over **inheritance** if lifetime dependency is not needed

---

## Real-World Example of Aggregation

```java
class Address {
    String city, state, country;

    public Address(String city, String state, String country) {
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.country = country;
    }
}

class Emp {
    int id;
    String name;
    Address address; // Emp HAS-A Address

    public Emp(int id, String name, Address address) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println(id + " " + name);
        System.out.println(address.city + " " + address.state + " " + address.country);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address address1 = new Address("gzb", "UP", "India");
        Address address2 = new Address("gno", "UP", "India");

        Emp e1 = new Emp(111, "Varun", address1);
        Emp e2 = new Emp(112, "Arun", address2);

        e1.display();
        e2.display();
    }
}
```

### Output

```
111 Varun
gzb UP India
112 Arun
gno UP India
```

## Diagram: HAS-A Relationship (Aggregation)

```plaintext
+-----------+         +-----------+
|  Employee |<>------>|  Address  |
+-----------+         +-----------+
| -id       |         | -city     |
| -name     |         | -state    |
| -address  |         | -country  |
+-----------+         +-----------+
```

Legend:

* `<>——>` indicates aggregation
* `Employee` has a reference to `Address`, but `Address` can exist independently

## Summary

| Feature             | Inheritance         | Aggregation           |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Relationship        | IS-A                | HAS-A                 |
| Lifetime Dependency | Strong              | Weak                  |
| Reusability         | Via extending class | Via referencing class |
| Flexibility         | Less                | More                  |

---

## Best Practices

* Use **inheritance** only when there's a permanent **IS-A** relationship.
* Use **aggregation** when code **reusability** is needed without tight coupling.
* **Avoid deep inheritance chains** and **prefer composition** for flexibility.

## Conclusion

Aggregation is a core concept in object-oriented programming that helps model real-world relationships between objects. It's widely used in Java for promoting modularity, reuse, and cleaner design.
